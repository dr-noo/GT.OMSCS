04-05 Features
==============

Objectives
----------
1. Benefits of Feature Detection and Matching in Images
2. Characteristics of Good Features
3. Corners and Good Features
4. Harris Corner Detector Algorithm
5. Stages of a SIFT detector

Image Matching
--------------
- Translation (change in x and y)
- Rotation (change in x, y, and rotation angle; 3 degree of freedom)
- Scale (4 parameters {x, y, theta, scale} variations)
- affine 
- perspective

Finding Features
----------------
Goals - Find points in an image that can be 
 - found in other images
 - found precisely - well localized
 - found reliably - well matched

Characteristics of Good Features
--------------------------------
